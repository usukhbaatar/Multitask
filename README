= Overview

Multitask is a CakePHP plugin designed as a proof of concept task manager for non-interactive tasks.

It consists of:

	MultitaskerShell - a daemon that manages the tasks/threads
	MultitaskQueuedTask - a model for creating tasks
	ThreadedTask - a base class for your tasks

It uses a slightly modified version of PHP_Fork to handle the threading.

= Requirements

PHP needs to be configured with pcntl and shmop extensions, as it uses PHP_Fork to handle threading.

I have only tested it on PHP5. Please let me know if you get it working on PHP4.

= Windows Compatibility

Although the pcntl and shmop extensions don't run on Windows, I have added "linear threading" (ie. no threading) so you can test the functionality of your tasks on Windows.
